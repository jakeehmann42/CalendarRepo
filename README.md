# CalendarRepo

## Description
Create an index.html, style.css, and script.js to create a
calendar API.


## Installation
Add the repository to your GitHub account, then make sure the root 
level is at master so we can publish our site. Copy and paste the URL into the browser.
Copy the index and css files from the uofa folder that was given to us.

## Usage
Basically every calendar function on this API should work correctly
along with things being color coded for maximum neatness
